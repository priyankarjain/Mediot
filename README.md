Skype bot to give details about the queried TV shows

This bot was developed as a part of Microsoft Code.Fun.do competition held in my college.
It uses microsoft Bot framework and azure services for handling its server. It gives you the detailed information of the shows you searched and provides interactive interface for user interaction. Using TVMaze api helps to retrieve the correct information for the show.

TO deploy it software required:
1. Visual Studio 2015 update 3
2. Microsoft Bot connecter
IMP: remove the azure id in the details and provide the id as given in the BOT connector.
